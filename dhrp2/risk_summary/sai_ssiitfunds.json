The document highlights a reliance on external parties (SEFs, clearing members) and regulatory compliance, indicating areas where the Fund has limited direct control. Mitigation strategies are largely focused on monitoring, diversification, and seeking legal counsel, which may not fully address the underlying risks. More proactive risk management strategies, such as stress testing and scenario analysis for derivatives and credit risks, could be beneficial."
